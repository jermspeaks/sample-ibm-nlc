Michigan Medicaid Expansion Waiver: The Healthy Michigan Program

On December 30, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved Michigan's Section 1115 waiver request granting a three-year Medicaid expansion demonstration. The demonstration applies to all adults who are eligible for Medicaid through Medicaid expansion, with the exception of those whom the state determines to be medically frail.

Enrollment in the program began on April 1, 2014.

On September 1, 2015 Michigan submitted a waiver amendment to CMS as required by the state’s expansion legislation to continue the Healthy Michigan Plan beyond April 30, 2016. The request was approved December 17, 2015 by CMS with some modifications.

Features

Delivery system: Coverage is through Medicaid managed care plans. After April 1, 2018 (4 years after the launch of the Healthy Michigan program) all individuals over 100% of the federal poverty line who fail to complete healthy behavior activities will be moved into premium assistance (private option) coverage on the marketplace.

Benefits: All required benefits for the Medicaid expansion population are covered. For those enrollees who move to private option coverage, the state will provide wrap-around benefits to ensure enrollees have the full suite of Medicaid benefits.

Premiums: Enrollees with incomes above 100 percent of the federal poverty level pay a premium set at 2 percent of income.  Non-payment cannot result in disenrollment, but it can create a collectable debt to the state. Enrollees with incomes at or below poverty do not have to pay premiums.
Health Savings Accounts:  Individual accounts are established by the state and are funded by the state and enrollee contributions. Individuals receive monthly statements of health care expenditures against an established account budget. Health care costs exceeding the individual's account budget are paid by the Healthy Michigan program. If a beneficiary becomes ineligible for Medicaid, the account balance will be put into a voucher he or she can use to buy private insurance.
Cost-sharing: Standard state Medicaid cost-sharing applies. There is a pre-paid cost-sharing feature that connects with individual accounts (see below).

Pre-paid cost-sharing.  There is no cost-sharing during the first six months of an individual's enrollment. After that, cost sharing is pre-paid to the state quarterly. Individuals' pre-paid cost sharing amounts are calculated for six-month periods based on the prior six months of service use, pro-rated. Unpaid cost-sharing can be considered a debt to the state, but individuals cannot be disenrolled or denied care for failure to pay.

The September, 2015 waiver amendment requested an increase in the 5 percent aggregate cost sharing cap to 7 percent of monthly or quarterly income for enrollees who chose to stay in regular managed care. In the amendment’s approval, CMS did not mention this request and did not authorize a waiver of Sec. 1916(f) that would allow the state to charge any enrollee up to 7 percent of income on cost-sharing.
Wellness program: Enrollees can lower their quarterly co-payments and/or monthly premiums by participating in certain healthy behaviors. Beginning April 1, 2018 all enrollees above the federal poverty line will be required to work with their physicians on certain health improving strategies. If they do not, they will be moved into marketplace QHP premium assistance.
